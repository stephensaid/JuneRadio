     # release, long press and sequences with event definitions and callbacks.
     # EasyButton is an small Arduino library for debouncing momentary contact
     # switches like tactile buttons. It uses events and callbacks to trigger
     # actions when a button is pressed once or held for a given duration.
     # It also provides a sequence counter to be able to rise an event when a
     # given pattern of presses has been matched.
